# CS50 - Network 
This project is a personal educational exercise based on [CS50W Project 4: Network](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/projects/4/network/), from Harvard's CS50 course *Web Programming with Python and JavaScript*. The base code was downloaded from [commerce.zip](https://cdn.cs50.net/web/2020/spring/projects/4/network.zip) as provided by CS50. The project implements a Threads-like social network web application that allows users to create posts, follow other users, and interact through likes and edits.
